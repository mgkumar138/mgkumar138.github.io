### Research interests
We experience how the world works and learn internal world models to solve new problems quickly.
How does the brain learn these internal representations and use them to predict the next state, best action and utility? 
It has also been shown that these world models are distorted in those suffering from neurological disorders. 
If we can rectify these world models, can we solve neurological disorders?
<br>
<br>
To explore these questions, I develop artificially intelligent systems, based on theory and experimental results, 
to develop our understanding of learning and intelligence, and how it might fail. 
My aspiration is to then develop technologies to improve learning outcomes 
(e.g. Human-Computer Interfaces, Brain Stimulation etc.) and alleviate 
learning disabilities that are associated with these disorders.


### Research background
I will be joining the Harvard Machine Learning Foundations Group as a postdoctoral fellowship in September 2023. 
<br>
<br>
Currently, I am a research scientist at the Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), A*STAR advised by 
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-cheston-tan">Cheston Tan</a> 
developing multi-modal reasoning datasets and models.
<br>
<br>
In 2022, I completed my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP).
I was co-advised by <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/lsi/principal-investigators-3/dr-andrew-tan-yong-yi/">Andrew Tan</a> and 
<a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/yen-shih-cheng/">Shih-Cheng Yen</a> and collaborated with 
<a href="http://camilolibedinsky.com/">Camilo Libedinsky</a>. 
<br>
<br>
My doctoral thesis was to develop a neural network-based reinforcement learning agent that used biologically plausible learning rules to 
learn multiple new paired associations after a single trial (One-shot learning) in a spatial navigation context. 
<br>
<br>
I completed my B.Sc in Life Sciences in 2017 at the National University of Singapore where 
I worked on Brain-Computer Interfaces to control wheelchair using either human EEG or macaque intracortical spike data.
<br>
<br>
Besides research, I co-founded <a href="https://nugen.ai">Nugen.ai</a> that hopes to characterize 
affective states during learning to aid parents and teachers in personalizing education. 
I also love to tour either on my <a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/record-breaking-trip-to-gain-experience/">motorcycle</a> or backpacking, 
and be involved in the <a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/news-reports/sangae-muzhangu-won-gold-saadhana-project-won-platinum">arts</a> scene.
