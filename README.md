## Welcome to Ganesh's page!

<body>
I am generally curious about how we learn models of thee world and utilize them to solve new problems quickly. 
To satisfy my curiosity, I take inspiration from artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience.
My aspiration is to develop strategies (e.g. Human-Computer Interfaces, Brain Stimulation etc.) to improve learning outcomes in children and alleviate 
learning disabilities for patients with ADHD, depression and autism.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I am a research scientist at the Center for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), A*STAR advised by 
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-cheston-tan">Cheston Tan</a> 
developing  datasets and neuro-symbolic models to perform visual reasoning (Grounded intelligence).
<br>
<br>
I am also a Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP) 
and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
I am co-advised by <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/lsi/principal-investigators-3/dr-andrew-tan-yong-yi/">Andrew Tan</a> and 
<a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/yen-shih-cheng/">Shih-Cheng Yen</a> and, collaborate with 
<a href="http://camilolibedinsky.com/">Camilo Libedinsky</a>. 
<br>
<br>
My thesis was to develop biologically plausible neural network models and reinforcement learning rules to 
learn multiple new paired associations in a spatial navigation task after a single trial (One-shot learning). 
Prior to my PhD, I worked on Brain-Computer Interfaces to control wheelchair using either human EEG or macaque intracortical spike data.
<br>
<br>
Besides research, I love to tour (either on my 
<a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/record-breaking-trip-to-gain-experience/">motorcycle</a> or backpacking), 
dabble in entrepreneurship (e.g. <a href="https://nugen.ai">Education Technology</a>), 
and immerse into the arts &
