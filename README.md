## Welcome to Ganesh's page!

<body>
I am Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme (ISEP).
I am advised by <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/lsi/principal-investigators-3/dr-andrew-tan-yong-yi/">Dr Andrew Tan</a> and 
<a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/yen-shih-cheng/">Dr Shih Cheng Yen</a>. 
<br>
<br>
I am curious about how we learn the structure of our world and utilize our prior knowledge to solve new problems quickly. 
My thesis is to develop biologically plausible neural network models and reinforcement learning rules that is able to 
learn new paired associations in one-shot (after a single training exposure). 
<br>
<br>
Besides research, I love to tour (either on my 
<a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/record-breaking-trip-to-gain-experience/">motorcycle</a> or backpacking), 
dabble in entrepreneurship (e.g. <a href="https://nugen.ai">Education Technology</a>), 
and immerse into the arts & 
<a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/news-reports/sangae-muzhangu-won-gold-saadhana-project-won-platinum">theatre</a> scene!
